The convertL1ToScanam.py script is now available within HIPE.
To use it, include the following line in your processing script:
   from herschel.pacs.spg.phot import ConvertL1ToScanamTask

It will print the fraction of samples flagged as glitches.
If this fraction is greater than 1%, it probably means that the
deglitching was too aggressive, and it is then highly recommended
to revise or cancel it.
